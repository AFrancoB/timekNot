-- glosario:
---- Voice is an ongoing or finished or yet-to-be-played musical idea enabled by 
---- Block is a rhythmic pattern of onsets
---- Onset a moment in time when a sound is instantiated
---- An Event is an Onset with an Index
---- Index is a mark that allows me to identify the position of the onset so sounds and sound characteristics can be attached to it
---- process-oriented index: an int identifier for each onset on a flow of onsets. 
---- eventIndex is the way I will refer to process oriented indexes
---- structure-oriented index: an int identifier for each segment on a voice and an array to identifier internal events in a voice: The head is the 'natural' subdivisions of the voice, each new element in the array is a new subdivision
---- a structure oriented index has a voice index and a structure index. A voice index is an Int while the Structure Index is an Array Int. The notation I have made for the structure oriented index is: 3-0.2.4  to the left of the (-) is the voice index and to the right of it is the event position in the rhythmic idea. The head of the array is the top level of the nested subdivisions and the last is the deepest level of the subdivisions.

-- up here needs a a function where tempoMap and auralMap are compared:
---- the keys of the tempoMap should be split in the -, then compare the auralMap with each of the prefixes of the tempoMap, if they coincide add the sufix of the tempoMap key to the key of the auralMap:

-- can-0, can-1, can-2 ...
-- can.s = bla bla...

-- needs to produce an auralMap that is:
-- can-0 aural, can-1 sameAural, can-2 sameAural

-- or:
-- can-0, can-1, can-2 ...
-- can[0].s = bla bla...
-- can-0 aural
--or:
-- can-0, can-1, can-2 ...
-- can[1..2].s = bla bla...
-- can-1 aural
-- can-2 aural


------after this exists, the auralMap should change from:
---------- Map String (List Aural) to:
------------- Map String (List (Tuple Aural Transposition))
